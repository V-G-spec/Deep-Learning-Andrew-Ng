Files made while completing Deep Learning course offered on [Coursera by DeepLearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=17-DeepLearning-IN&utm_content=17-DeepLearning-IN&campaignid=6495527979&adgroupid=119719595459&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=507236116448&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAjwqvyFBhB7EiwAER786Ve-_G-xCrGmOCD7_PBUaDOpAwBz68NzaT7vSFKy-I-5dWH0iFPExhoC3fkQAvD_BwE>)

I could not download all the related files in time, or at all. So I downloaded them from other Github repositories. However, these were only helper files and not the actual
```ipynb``` files on which assignments were to be completed. The ```ipynb``` notebooks are entirely my own work

#### These are mostly for my future reference. Don't copy to complete your own Coursera assignments because it is extremely sad that you think an online course that you completed by blatantly copying someone else's work will add any value to your Résumé or your skillset
